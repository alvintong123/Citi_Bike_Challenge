# Citi_Bike_Challenge 
## Overview 
In this Challenge we wanted to visualize data from our CSV file on bike rentals to gain some insight about customer demographics and behaviors. 
## Results
In this case we were able to discover Males who are subscribers heavily use our bikes the most often. In addition, they tend to use our bikes less than 20 minutes at a time. We were also able to indentify the time periods where our bikes are used the most, usually early in the morning or in the evenings. This is most likely due to customers using our bikes either as a pre/post-work activities or commuting to and from work. This is further supported with the evidence that there is no real preference on weekends when most people do not work. Our visualizations are included below.
## Summary
I think two extra visualizations that will enhance our analysis would be looking at popular station locations. This way we could efficiently allocate resources to high traffic areas. In addition, we should also visualize our age demographic of our customers since different age ranges would dictate things like marketing campaigns, product enhancements, and even new station locations.
